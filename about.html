        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>SkinWise</strong>, an AI-powered skin disease detection platform dedicated to making dermatological care more accessible and affordable.

            <li>Users can answer a set of predefined questions to describe their symptoms.</li>
            <li>They can also upload photos for AI-based analysis.</li>
            <li>Chatting facility with a chatbot specializing in skin health is also available .</li>
            <li>Our system identifies possible skin conditions and provides predictions about their skin conditions.</li>
